    <h1>Tulsi Coffee</h1>
    <h2>Calm Your Mind. Power Your Day.</h2>
    <h3>“Kapha-Vata-Hara, Hridaya, Krimihara, Vishaghna”</h3>
        <h4>(Meaning: balances doshas, improves heart function, kills parasites, and neutralizes toxins.)</h4>
        Tulsi Coffee is a revolutionary fusion of two ancient powers — the sacred Tulsi (Holy Basil) and rich, aromatic coffee beans — designed to energize your body while calming your soul. Known as the “Queen of Herbs”, Tulsi has been praised for over 5,000 years in Ayurveda, Vedas, and even ancient Puranas as a divine adaptogen, stress reliever, and immunity booster.
